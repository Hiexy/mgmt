# FIXME: We'd like to pre-compute the interpolation if we can, so that we can
# check this code statically... For now, we can't, so it's only possible with
# the PrintfAllowNonStaticFormat option enabled. This isn't bad per se, however
# any static compilation/optimization we can by "running early" would be great.
