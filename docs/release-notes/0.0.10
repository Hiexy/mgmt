* There's a new resource called `KV`. Short examples exist, but I
haven't yet published a whole integration showing the usefulness.

* A major race was fixed. The issue of what to do with BackPokes during
start/pause was never previously solved. I had this as an open issue on
my whiteboard for a while, and I finally got some time to work through
it. The answer wasn't that difficult, but I think it was shrouded in
some tunnel vision. See the commit messages and source comments for the
details.

* The GAPI grew four new associated World API methods: StrWatch,
StrGet, StrSet, StrDel, and the associated etcd backed implementations.
These are quite useful when combined with the KV resource.

* There are now P/V style counting semaphores available as metaparams.
This is particularly cool because the implementation is (AFAIK,
assuming no bugs) dead-lock free! This is mentioned in my recent blog
post.

* See the git log for more NEWS, and sorry for anything notable I left
out!

BUGS

* There's a `concurrent map write` bug in the semaphore implementation
which is fixed in git master. Since it was a race, it was only caught
after this release was made. I should also figure out if the sema check
should go after the BackPoke or not.
