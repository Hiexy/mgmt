There's some great new stuff that landed since
0.0.13, including:

* amazon AWS EC2 resource is now in git master.

* more automatic edges from new contributor Guillaume Herail (xiu)

* a move to golang 1.8 or higher

and so much more... This will probably be the last release before the
language lands in git master. It's a pretty giant patch coming :/

NEWS

* We're > 1k stars on GitHub now. It's a silly metric, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

* Jonathan Gold has done a lot of hard work on the AWS EC2 resource,
and it's now in git master. There are still many things we'd like to
do, but it's a great start on what is a *monster* resource, and
hopefully it will inspire others to get involved.

In particular, it was a great learning experience (for me in
particular!) about how bad the EC2 golang API is. There are some
notable design bugs we found, and if anyone from Amazon engineering
would like to reach out to us, we'd love to provide some constructive
ideas.

* Guillaume Herail (xiu) wrote some really nice patches, and picked up
on the autoedges API very quickly. Hopefully he'll have time to work on
even more!

* Paul Morgan sent us some nice shell fixups-- many more exist in an
open PR that didn't make it into this release. Hopefully we'll get
those merged by 0.0.15

* Felix Frank did a few Puppet compiler fix ups. I think he's been
refreshing his work with new resources recently...

* We're looking for help writing Google, DigitalOcean, Rackspace, etc
resources if anyone is interested, reach out to us. Particularly if
there is support from those organizations as well.

* See the git log for more NEWS, and for anything notable I left out!
