I've just released 0.0.9!

Release tags are now signed with my GPG key.

From now on, I'm going to try and write a release email to the list
with information about each release. Here we go!

NEWS

* There were far more commits that went into this release than I was
expecting. I delayed a while because of some nasty races and deadlocks
I encountered when cleaning some cruft out of the engine.

134 files changed, 5394 insertions(+), 2168 deletions(-)

* We grew initial integration with Prometheus thanks to new contributor
`roidelapluie`.

* The file resource can now chown/chmod files! Thanks to new
contributor `mildred`.

* The virt resource can now hotplug/hotunplug cpus. This made for some
dope demos at CfgMgmtCamp. Special thanks to pkrempa for helping me
with the libvirt API.

* Native testing of all the golang code is now enabled again. I broke
this when I split mgmt up into multiple packages. (Sorry!) Golang tests
in foo_test.go should now run and be tested automatically. I'd
especially like it if someone wrote some for pgraph/pgraph.go:
GraphSync().

* Documentation has been significantly improved. We have a resource
guide (for writing new native resources) and much more. We also now
build the docs as a RTD project:
https://mgmt.readthedocs.io/en/master/
Patches welcome to make it style as pretty as GitHub markdown does.

* See the git log for more NEWS, and sorry for anything notable I left
out!

BUGS

* I hope to resolve this soon, but it shouldn't block further
development on git master for now. The issue: if you make extremely
high speed graph changes to graphs involving the virt resource, it can
eventually cause a panic. This is being tracked here:
https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt-go/issues/7 (help welcome!)

GLUSTERFS

I've started working on some stuff for Glusterd so that it can embed
mgmt as a lib, and use the resource model to simplify cluster
management. This will involve writing Gluster resources in mgmt
(volume, brick, etc...) and all sorts of other fun stuff. If you'd like
to participate, please LMK!

MISC

We're still looking for new contributors, and there are easy, medium and hard issues available! You're also welcome to suggest your own! Please join us in #mgmtconfig on Freenode IRC, or ping this list if you'd like help getting started!
