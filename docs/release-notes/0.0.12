I've just released version 0.0.12 of mgmt!

Sorry if I've been more quiet than usual, I've had to focus a lot of my
time on GlusterFS related features ($dayjob official directives) and
work there.

One goal is to try and use libmgmt to either wholly or partially re-
implement glusterd. As a result, a lot of my upstream focus has been
re-prioritized to features needed for that effort.

I wrote a PoC called gd3: https://github.com/purpleidea/gd3
(It has now bit-rotted compared to upstream mgmt, but is easy to fix.)
The initial scope looks like it will be much smaller, but hopefully
this is interesting to you too. Ping me if you'd like to help.

We desperately need your contributions if we're going to get mgmt
standalone into a MVP. To motivate you, there's some great new stuff
that landed since 0.0.11, including:

* a great new YAML parser from contributor Mildred

* a huge pgraph refactor (to remove internal deps and cycles)

* a great amount of new tests and testing

and so much more...

NEWS

 76 files changed, 7549 insertions(+), 4269 deletions(-)

* The svc resource now also supports user services

* There's a fabulous new yaml parser that fixes a longstanding issue in
my original code. Try it with --yaml2. I'll remove the old one
eventually. Thanks to contributor Mildred for this great work!

* Refactored the lib/ etcd usage into the GAPI's for a cleaner main

* World API grew some new methods for libmgmt users

* pgraph refactor and cleanup, now it's a fairly clean standalone pkg

* pgraph functions to flatten/merge in subgraphs along with examples

* Giant resource refactor to hopefully make things more logical, and to
simplify the resource API. This also introduces the mgraph struct to
add the higher level graph knowledge outside of pgraph.

* A partial implementation of a "Graph" (recursive subgraph?) resource!
See the code for details, as help is wanted to finish this. This should
help elucidate what the most elegant design for the mgmt core should
be.

* Send/Recv support for the exec resource as output, stdout, and stderr

* GAPI improvements to support exit requests and fast pausing

* AutoEdge API improvements including a fix+test for a regression

* A possible fix for the possible etcd server startup race

* A fun amount of new tests all over including for gometalinter

* See the git log for more NEWS, and for anything notable I left out!

BUGS

* We fixed a bunch of stuff, and added more tests!
